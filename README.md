# Gender-Recognition
Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis


This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, 
based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. 
The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. 
The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, 
with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).


These files include a bunch of popular methods nowadays, such as Neural Network, SVM, 
and PCA (which is used to kill dimensions):


--voice.csv is the dataset of this project.

--NN.ipynb is self-made simple Neural Network which works really well.

--PCA.ipynb is a self-made simple PCA algorithm to reduce dimension.

--PCA_matplotlib.ipynb applied PCA method from matplotlib packge.

--PCA_sklearn.ipynb applied PCA method from sklearn pack.

--sklearn and matplotlib are two great packages for machine learning.

--start_up.R consists of 2 basic methods(baseline method and logistic regression)


The codes are all writen in Python(except start_up.R) and can be run directly without compile.


And I also uploaded some files which implemented certain existed famous packages like matplotlib, sklearn, etc.


This is my first git-hub project, let me know if you have any suggestions or critique.


Also welcome you guys to discuss with me in field of Machine Learning, Data Mining, Programming, etc.


Thank you guys for noticing this project.
