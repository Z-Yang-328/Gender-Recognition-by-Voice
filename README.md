# Gender-Recognition
Gender Recognition by Voice and Speech Analysis

This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, 
based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. 
The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. 
The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, 
with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).

These files include a bunch of popular methods nowadays, such as Neural Network, SVM, 
and PCA (which is used to kill dimensions)

The codes are all writen in Python and can be run directly without compile.

And I also uploaded some files which implemented certain existed famous packages like matplotlib, sklearn, etc.

This is my first git-hub project, let me know if you have any suggestions or critique.

Also welcome you guys to discuss with me in field of Machine Learning, Data Mining, Programming, etc.

Thank you guys for noticing this project.
